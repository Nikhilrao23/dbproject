Database Administration Project
				Inventory System
My proposed project is a implementation of an inventory system for a online computer store. A database used for storing and administering all types of data required for efficient and accurate warehouse inventory management. This may include modules or fields for keeping track of all items and locations, requisitions, back orders, required levels of inventory on hand, reorder points, lead times, inventory error tracking, and more. This type of system may interface with an ERP and other applications. The purpose of an inventory system is to keep track of what you have in your small store, large office or product development factory. If you know what you have available for sale or to build products, you can easily satisfy the needs of your customers when they contact you to buy your products. The inventory system informs you when you need to purchase more products or supplies. The main challenge is the creation of the database schema instance and of the application programs. And also provide any revisions made to the specification in need. I am going to develop a menu driven application for this inventory  database in a functional method.
